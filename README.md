this is a library Management System .
its built with .NET Framework v 4.8 ,
using c++ CLR ,
and database Of Sqlite (included as .dll)connected to the file lib.db ,
its built  with the design pattern MVC(Model-View-Controller)->Manual working .

before You try to use this project on your pc you will have to do some refrence to a certain library.
if you dont you wont and cant use the code .
in your project directory there is a folder named lib ->that has 4 files inside for sqlite Library.
you will reftrence this in your project to be able to use sqlite.

after you refrence it you are all set to start cleen-build before running the application .

Good Luck.
